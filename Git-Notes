to become a super user, which can downloa dand install packages

1.  sudo su -

To install git:

 $ yum install git -y


 mkdir myprojects
 cd myprojects
 touch index1.html
 ls

Intsialise git 
  git init
  ls -al

.git folder will be there

Scenario 1:
***********

Check if git is tracking you files or not in the workspace


git status


git add filename ==> single file

git add file1 file2 ==>  will add 2 files

$ git add . ==> all the files will be stagged

$ git commit -m "message " ==> all the chnages & files will be commited

Scenario 2: git config
*******************

$ git config --global user.name sonal0409
$ git config --global user.email mittal.sonal04@gmail.com

To see the list of configurations:

 git config --list


Scenario 3: log in git
******************

 git log

 git log --oneline

 git show <commitid> ==> show all the details of the changes that have been commited

100644

 644  ==> current user ==> read and write permsision = 6
      ==> group users ==> read permission = 4
      ==> user ==> read permssion

chmod 666 filename

Scenario 4: How modified files with changes can be commited to Local repository
*********************

Take a file that is already committed OR which is already tracked by git

In this case no need to explicitly execute add command, you can directly commit all the changes using the command

   $ git commit -a -m "modified file" 

 - a  : take all the modified files or stagged files and commit them all


vim index1.html

press i

enter data

save the file:

press ESC key on keyboard

then enter the keys :wq! 

press enter key




Scenario 5: Delete a file and commit the changes to Local repo



Step 1: take an exisitng file and delete it 

 git rm newfile1  ==> delete file from LR & Working directory

Step 2: Check status of git, you will deleted file or change is stagged

you need to commit

 git commit -m "deleted file"

See the log

 $ git log --oneline


Scenario 6: revert the changes to its previous state

Select the required commit id

$ git log --oneline

see what happened in  that commit

$ git show 5f62be1   

Lets revert the commitid

whatever was commited, will go back to its previous state

 $ git revert <commitid>

When the above command is executed, 
git will open an editor for you, 
where you have to put a message as to why are your reverting
AND
git will perform revert action and generate a commit id for it

Expected :  file should be back to LR & WD

Scenario 7: Push the changes from LR to Github


Steps to create personal Access token

Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, 
or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

 Go to settings of the github account
 Scroll down and click on developer settings on the left
 on the left side click on personal access token
 Click on generate token
 > in Note give a unique name of token
 > expiration 30 days
 > scope ==> select repo

Scenario 8: Pull files from remote repository

Step1: create some new file in the remote repostiroy, which are not in your local repo

Step 2: go to local repo and pull these new changes form remote

here PULL ==>  Fetch the changes + Merge them with local repo and working directory

git config pull.rebase false

Scenario 9 : clone the remote repo to local

git clone reponame

Scenario 10: Forking in remote repo

click on for button on github repo

Scenario 11 : Branching & Merging

git branch feature

git checkout feature

make chnages and commit on branch

git checkout master

git merge feature master s

git branch -d feature

Scenario 12: Conflicts & resolve conflicts

Create a file on the remote repo with a new name : demo1

Step2:

Sonal also working on the same file Demo1 in her local machine

Step 3:

Sonal want to push her demo changes from local into remote file, so that somebody can review those changes

Observation: Push will not be successfull

it will reject the push


Step 4: because my push was rejected and I am asked to pull the chnages first from remote file, 
so lets execute pull command

$ git pull origin master

You will get into conflict, because git donot know where to merge the chnages fetched from remote in the local file

CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in Demo1
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


Step 5: Resolve the conflict


Review the changes in the file locally and commit the changes so as to resolve conflict


Step 6:

Once you resolve the conflicts, push the changes to remote
